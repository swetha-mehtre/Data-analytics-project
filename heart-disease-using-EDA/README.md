# Heart Disease Prediction using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

### 1. Introduction

This project focuses on performing an in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a heart disease dataset. The primary goal is to understand the underlying patterns, relationships, and distributions within the data that could contribute to heart disease. By visualizing the data and calculating key statistics, this analysis aims to lay a solid foundation for future machine learning models.

### 2. Dataset

The dataset used in this analysis is named `heart.csv`. It contains various medical and demographic features of individuals, which are potentially correlated with heart disease. The features include:
* Age
* Sex
* Chest pain type (cp)
* Resting blood pressure (trestbps)
* Cholesterol (chol)
* ... and other relevant medical indicators.

### 3. Methodology

The analysis follows a standard EDA workflow:
1.  **Data Loading:** The dataset is loaded and its initial structure is examined.
2.  **Data Cleaning:** We handle any missing values, check for data types, and address inconsistencies.
3.  **Descriptive Statistics:** We calculate summary statistics for each feature to understand their central tendency and spread.
4.  **Data Visualization:** We use various plots (histograms, box plots, scatter plots, correlation heatmaps) to visualize the data distribution, identify outliers, and discover relationships between features and the target variable (heart disease).

### 4. Key Findings

* **[Example Finding]:** A strong correlation was observed between chest pain type and the presence of heart disease.
* **[Example Finding]:** The distribution of cholesterol levels showed that individuals with heart disease tend to have a higher average cholesterol level.
* **[Example Finding]:** [Describe another interesting pattern or visualization you found].

*(Note: You should replace the example findings with your actual discoveries from the analysis.)*

### 5. Technologies Used

* **Python:** The core programming language for the analysis.
* **Pandas:** Used for data manipulation and analysis.
* **Matplotlib & Seaborn:** Used for creating static and statistical data visualizations.
* **Jupyter Notebook:** The environment where the analysis and visualizations were performed.

### 6. How to Run the Analysis

To replicate this analysis, you can open and run the `heart_disease_analysis.ipynb` Jupyter notebook file. Ensure you have all the required libraries installed.
